# Social-Media-Fake-News-Detection
3 Overview

This project Social Media Fake News Detection is a project aimed at detecting fake news on social media platforms. The repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that processes datasets of true and fake news articles to build a classification system. The code is implemented in Python using Google Colab, focusing on loading and inspecting news datasets as a foundation for fake news detection.

Dataset

The project uses two CSV files:





True.csv: Contains articles labeled as true news.



Fake.csv: Contains articles labeled as fake news.

Each dataset includes the following columns:





title: The title of the news article.



text: The full text of the article.



subject: The subject or category of the news (e.g., politicsNews, worldnews).



date: The publication date of the article.

The datasets are stored in Google Drive and accessed via the Colab notebook.

Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you need:





A Google Colab account with access to Google Drive.



Python libraries: pandas, numpy (additional libraries may be required for extended functionality).



The True.csv and Fake.csv files uploaded to your Google Drive's MyDrive directory.

Setup





Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/Bhavani-Rupa/Social-Media-Fake-News-Detection.git
cd Social-Media-Fake-News-Detection



Upload Datasets:





Place the True.csv and Fake.csv files in your Google Drive under the MyDrive directory.



Install Dependencies:





Ensure the required libraries are installed:

pip install pandas numpy



Run the Notebook:





Open the EnglishFakeNewsClassification.ipynb notebook in Google Colab.



Mount your Google Drive in Colab to access the datasets.



Execute the cells to load and inspect the datasets.

Usage

The EnglishFakeNewsClassification.ipynb notebook includes the following steps:





Mount Google Drive: Connects to Google Drive to access True.csv and Fake.csv.



Load Datasets: Reads the true and fake news datasets into pandas DataFrames using pandas.



Data Inspection: Displays the structure and content of the true news dataset.

To extend the project, you can:





Preprocess the text data (e.g., tokenization, stop word removal, stemming/lemmatization).



Train a machine learning or deep learning model (e.g., using scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch) to classify news as true or fake.



Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.



Visualize dataset insights (e.g., word clouds, subject distribution).

README.md: This file, providing project overview and setup instructions.



Note: The True.csv and Fake.csv datasets are not included in the repository due to their size and licensing constraints. Users must source these datasets separately and upload them to Google Drive.

Future Enhancements





Implement text preprocessing using NLP libraries like NLTK or spaCy.



Develop and train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, BERT-based models).



Add data visualization for exploratory data analysis (e.g., matplotlib, seaborn).



Include model evaluation and comparison of different algorithms.



Deploy the model as a web or mobile application for real-time fake news detection.
